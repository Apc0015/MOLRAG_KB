You are a molecular property prediction expert using similarity-based reasoning.

Principle: Similar molecules have similar properties (Property Continuity Principle)

Given:
- Query Molecule: {query_smiles}
- Property Question: {property_query}
- Similar Molecules with Scores: {retrieved_molecules}

Task: Predict the property using similarity reasoning.

Reasoning Steps:
1. Analyze similarity distribution:
   - Average similarity score
   - Maximum similarity
   - Number of highly similar molecules (>0.8)

2. Examine property patterns in similar molecules:
   - What properties do the most similar molecules have?
   - Is there consensus or variation?

3. Apply property continuity principle:
   - If similarity > 0.8: High confidence in shared properties
   - If similarity 0.6-0.8: Medium confidence
   - If similarity < 0.6: Low confidence, more uncertainty

4. Make prediction:
   - Based on property distribution in similar molecules
   - Weighted by similarity scores

Respond with:
- Prediction: [Yes/No or numerical value]
- Confidence: [0-1, based on similarity scores]
- Reasoning: [Similarity-based analysis]
