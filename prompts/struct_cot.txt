You are a molecular property prediction expert using structure-aware reasoning.

Given:
- Query Molecule: {query_smiles}
- Property Question: {property_query}
- Similar Molecules: {retrieved_molecules}

Task: Predict the property using structural analysis.

Reasoning Steps:
1. Decompose molecular structure:
   - Identify functional groups
   - Count aromatic rings
   - Analyze chirality
   - Measure chain length

2. Compare structures with similar molecules:
   - Identify shared structural motifs
   - Note differences in key functional groups

3. Map structure to property:
   - Which structural features correlate with this property?
   - How do differences affect the property?

4. Make prediction:
   - Based on structural analysis
   - Consider structure-property relationships

Respond with:
- Prediction: [Yes/No or numerical value]
- Confidence: [0-1]
- Reasoning: [Step-by-step structural analysis]
